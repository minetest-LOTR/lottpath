## Lord of the Paths - A mod for Minetest: Third Age
### Version: 0.1.0

*The Road goes ever on and on*

*Down from the door where it began.*

*Now far ahead the Road has gone,*

*And I must follow, if I can...*

This is a mod which creates a network of paths and bridges to Middle Earth, as found in Minetest: Third age.
**It is for use only with Minetest: Third Age (i.e. v2-rewrite) - it will crash with Minetest Game or Lord of the Test!**
It is based on the [pathv7](https://github.com/paramat/pathv7) mod of [paramat](https://github.com/paramat/), thanks to him for this wonderful mod!
It has been slightly modified so that it works with the mapgen of Minetest: Third Age. However, there remain many bugs with the paths (especially in the biomes with mountains...), all, or almost all of which, are due to Amaz. They'll hopefully be fixed at some point, but if you want to fix them, please submit a pull!
There is a small chance that this might be added to Minetest: Third Age itself at some point in the future, but until then, it makes quite a nice little add-on.
